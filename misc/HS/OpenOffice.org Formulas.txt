OpenOffice.org Formulas

Some notes on dealing with the OpenOffice.org formula editor.

To get a formula into your document:

  Insert | Object | Formula

This will give the formula editor at the bottom where they use a bastardized version of MathML.  Also make sure the selection dialog appears (View | Selection if it doesn't).  You can right-click in the formula editor to see what all is available.

One problem I've had is with variables coming out as italics.  For example:

4a div 3b

This doesn't give italics, but this does:

4*a div 3*b

What's wrong?  Well, you need *spaces* like this:

4 a div 3 b

This way it treats the a and b as separate entities rather than part of a "4a" thing.

If you want non-italics, use quotes:

"det" left [ matrix{2 # -3 ## 4 # 1} right ] ~ = phantom{}

Note also the "phantom" to keep oo.o from bitching that you have nothing on the right side of the equals.

For lots more tricks, see my algebra worksheets.  I really should put them on my website for all to learn from.
