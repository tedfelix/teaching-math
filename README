Teaching Math

This repo is a collection of math teaching resources that I've used over the years to teach my kids and grandkid.

FlashCards Addition 2.odt
  - Reduced set of flashcards with larger numbers on the right to maximize
    confusion.

MATHTEST.BAS
  - qbasic positive subtraction timed test program.  100 problems, gives time
    and score.  Logs progress to mathlog.txt.

mathtest.py
  - Port of MATHTEST.BAS to python.

misc
  - Directory dump of all the stuff I found related to math teaching from the
    2000's.  I plan on moving it to the root directory as I use it, then
    possibly re-arranging it all in a more organized way over time.
