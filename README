Teaching Math

This repo is a collection of math teaching resources that I've used over the years to teach my kids and grandkid.

addition-drill.py
  - Addition drill.  Select a number of problems and it will time you.  Avoids
    0's and 1's to a certain extent.  Logs results to mathlog.txt.

division-drill.py
  - Division drill.  Just like addition-drill.py.

"FlashCards Addition 2.odt"
  - Reduced set of flashcards with larger numbers on the right to maximize
    confusion.

"FlashCards Multiplication.odt"
  - Reduced with the commutative property.

"FlashCards Subtraction.odt"
  - Reduced to only contain those related to the 0-9 fact families.

MATHTEST.BAS
  - qbasic positive subtraction timed test program.  100 problems, gives time
    and score.  Logs progress to mathlog.txt.

misc
  - Directory dump of all the stuff I found related to math teaching from the
    2000's.  I plan on moving it to the root directory as I use it, then
    possibly re-arranging it all in a more organized way over time.

multiplication-drill.py
  - Multiplication drill.  Just like addition-drill.py.

subtraction-drill.py
  - Subtraction drill.  Just like addition-drill.py.
